# Memory Game

## Summary and objective

Program a memory game. Meaning, 6 cards in random order. Turn on click. Stay turned on the second click if the images are the same. If not, they turn back. Game ends when all cards are turned.

Idea is to further the understanding of object manipulation in the DOM, so no canvas. The image object order is to be random, or the game would be very easy indeed.
